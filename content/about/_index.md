Born in 1997, I graduated from the School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University in 2021 and joined metaPhorest, Waseda University's life and aesthetics platform, in 2020. Currently, I’m pursuing Daphnia swimming performance based on his swimming experience, with the aim of examining the relationship between humans and microorganisms (Daphnia).
