Born in 1997, I graduated from the School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University in 2021 and joined metaPhorest, Waseda University's life and aesthetics platform, in 2020. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing Daphnia swimming performance based on his swimming experience, with the aim of examining the relationship between humans and microorganisms (Daphnia).
