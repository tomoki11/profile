The Japan Foundation, Bangkok and BASE Playhouse with the support from FREAK Lab Thailand and Fablab Hamamatsu / TAKE-SPACE are proudly presenting “Short Circuit – Lunartic Dream and Princess Kaguya'' a work-in-progress exhibition aims to experiment communication and interaction through virtual reality and brain waves. At a time when people are restricted from physical travelling, why not fly out to the moon?! We invite you to explore the exciting digital world, produced by Thai and Japanese artists.  
.  
Inspired by the story of Princess Kaguya, Japanese folklore about a beautiful princess from the Moon who is raised on Earth with the beauty that attracts Emperor of Japan. After discovered her celestial origins, she returns to the moon. At Von Karman crater on the dark side of the Moon, the princess is senescence, leaving her memory as regolith remnants, terraforming it into a primordial soup will bring the princess back to life. The participants will undertake the Moon ventures and plan the rescue mission with their friends through virtual-reality exploration then modify the land condition using interactive augmented-reality moon sandbox. Finally, print your memory as a three-dimensional form using brain waves and moon dust. Sample of plant experimentation with lab-grade lunar regolith and Primordial soup will display at the exhibition.
