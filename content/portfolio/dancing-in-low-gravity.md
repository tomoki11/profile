#### Exhibition Overview

(Text taken from the [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/3710821059031343/3710821109031338/))

The Japan Foundation, Bangkok and BASE Playhouse with the support from FREAK Lab Thailand and Fablab Hamamatsu / TAKE-SPACE are proudly presenting “Short Circuit – Lunartic Dream and Princess Kaguya'' a work-in-progress exhibition aims to experiment communication and interaction through virtual reality and brain waves. At a time when people are restricted from physical travelling, why not fly out to the moon?! We invite you to explore the exciting digital world, produced by Thai and Japanese artists.  
.  
Inspired by the story of Princess Kaguya, Japanese folklore about a beautiful princess from the Moon who is raised on Earth with the beauty that attracts Emperor of Japan. After discovered her celestial origins, she returns to the moon. At Von Karman crater on the dark side of the Moon, the princess is senescence, leaving her memory as regolith remnants, terraforming it into a primordial soup will bring the princess back to life. The participants will undertake the Moon ventures and plan the rescue mission with their friends through virtual-reality exploration then modify the land condition using interactive augmented-reality moon sandbox. Finally, print your memory as a three-dimensional form using brain waves and moon dust. Sample of plant experimentation with lab-grade lunar regolith and Primordial soup will display at the exhibition.

#### Workshop Overview

Three workshops were held during the exhibition, this time with the following titles and dates

Dancing in the (Primordial) Soup: Mix Reality Dance on Moon and Mars Gravity Sunday, 14th March 2021, 19.00 - 20.30

After receiving dance lectures from two artists, participants of the workshop will actually express their bodies in a virtual reality. Kornkarn Rungsawang gave a lecture on "vagina dance" inspired by female/vagina and Matsumura gave a lecture on "microorganisms dance" inspired by zooplankton, E. coli and hyperthermophilic bacteria. Rungsawang improvised and fused the two dances into a performance in virtual reality with workshop participants.

The dance was inspired by the primordial soup, the "woman" as a symbol of the creation of life, and the "microorganisms" as a symbol of the origin of life.

#### Microorganisms Dance 

Deriving the idea from the project to imitate the way Daphnia magna swims, the dance was constructed by taking up organisms strongly related to the origin of life, such as hyperthermophiles and cyanobacteria, as well as fungi and reproductive cells that are relevant to human life, such as sperm and E. coli.

The goal was not simply to express the sense of unity and melting of life associated with the primordial soup, but to pursue and express that sense while taking cues from the actual movements of microorganisms.
